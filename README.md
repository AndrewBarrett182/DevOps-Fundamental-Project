## Brief

The overall objective for this project is:

> To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

This is to demonstrate my capability with the technologies and concepts I have been taught and assessing my development against the SFIA framework. 

### Additional Requirements

A list of the scope/requirements of this project are as follows:

> A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project. It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that I faced creating my project.

> A relational database used to store data persistently for the project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to demonstrate my understanding, I am also required to model a relationship.

> Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture I will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment. 

> A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on my Kanban Board.

> Fully designed test suites for the application I am creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application. I must provide high test coverage in my backend and provide consistent reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

> A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.

> Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
